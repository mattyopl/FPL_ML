So go to Data > Fixture Data. Here you should see folders by season of each team's stats. If you go to By Season folder, you'll find sheets of merged data of all teams
by season (so 2015-16.xlsx is just all the sheets in 2015-16 folder merged). I want you to write a python script to create 2021-22.xlsx using the data in the 2021-22 folder.
Next, add the data in 2021-22.xlsx to the end of complete.xlsx. To do this I'd recommend using packages openpyxl and pandas, but you can do whatever you want provided it 
gives me the sheets in the correct format with all the required data.
